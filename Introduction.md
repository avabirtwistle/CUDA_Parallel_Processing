## What is the purpose of this project?
Parallel processing is a method in which independent tasks are executed in parallel resulting in reduced execution time. With the growing popularity of fields like machine learning, the demand for processing large datasets efficiently has increased. Parallel processing addresses this by handling the execution of these tasks more efficiently. The purpose is to explore how parallel processing is used through hands-on experience and projects. As part of this, I will share updates about what I am learning, how it applies to the projects I am doing, how the projects can be 
applied to (or related to) real-world scenarios and to share milestones.


## Parallel Processing: What's the Point?
A GPU has thousands of cores that can each run a thread. If we have a bunch on independent tasks where the result of one is independent of the result of the other, then we can run these in parallel (simultaneously).
This can be helpful for dealing with large data sets or for matrix multiplication for example.
