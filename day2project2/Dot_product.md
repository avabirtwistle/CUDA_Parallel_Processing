## Dot Product in Machine Learning
### Introduction
When you take a vector and take the dot product of it and itself, you end up with the square of that vectors magnitude.
### Neural Networks
In neural networks data is input and passed through the network's layers. At each layer, there are two pieces of information it receives: the input numbers which represent your data (pixel values 
in n image for example) and weights which are numbers that tell the network how much importance to give each product.
